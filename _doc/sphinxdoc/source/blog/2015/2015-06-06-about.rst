    I first intented to use this module to speed up writing
    map reduce jobs by using a kind of functional syntax to define the job.
    I allow easy testing on local data and some functions to translate
    this job into various map reduce languages SQL, PIG, Python.
    But I do not have time to really work on it and complete it.
